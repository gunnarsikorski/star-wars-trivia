## Problems / Hurdles:

I found it difficult to make my code more dry. I feel as though I was very close to getting it to do what I wanted in a much more efficient way but I couldn't find what I was missing, which I know is just syntax I'm missing, probably a line or two. I also couldn't figure a way to have a score be kept and saved for the user which I spent a lot of time trying to figure out but was unsuccessful. However, I did like struggling through and making it work in my own way and then I can learn how to improve and refactor it down the line.
