					Come and test your knowledge! Go through a number of Star Wars trivia
					questions and see just how well you stack up. Do you possess a Jedi
					Master's level of knowledge? Or more like the know-how of a womp rat?
				</p>
				<p>
					The following questions focus mainly on the original trilogy and
					prequels, and who knows, maybe some Clone Wars questions for those
					real fans. Staying away from the sequel trilogy.... thanks Kathleen
					Kennedy.

					We will watch your career with great interest... may the force be with
					you.
