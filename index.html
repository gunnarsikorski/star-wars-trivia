            Come and test your knowledge! Go through a number of Star Wars trivia questions and see just how well you stack up. Do you possess a Jedi Master's level of knowledge? Or more like the know-how of a womp rat?

            The following questions focus mainly on the original trilogy and prequels, and who knows, maybe some Clone Wars questions for those real
            fans. Staying away from the sequel trilogy.... thanks Kathleen Kennedy.
